## Project

Chekhov Sakhalin 1890 Census Data Analysis

## Dataset Description

This dataset is being built from indexed person-level records based on Anton Chekhov’s 1890 Sakhalin census.

The final database is designed as a flat person-level CSV where one row represents one person. The expected combined database size is approximately 7,445 records.

The source is a readable/searchable PDF with an existing text layer. OCR is not the primary extraction method. Printed book page numbers must be preserved for verification.

## Unit of Analysis

Individual person record.

## ID Rules

### `person_id`

Format:

```text
P + global sequential person number, zero-padded to 6 digits

Example:
P000001
P000125
P007445

person_id is the stable primary ID and must not depend on settlement, household number, page number, or district.

source_position_id

Format:
D-SS-HHH-PPPP

Where:
| Component | Meaning                                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `D`       | District code                                          |
| `SS`      | Settlement order                                       |
| `HHH`     | Household number, zero-padded to 3 digits when numeric |
| `PPPP`    | Person order within locality, zero-padded to 4 digits  |

Example:
3-48-002-0005
